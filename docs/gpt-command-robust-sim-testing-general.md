Here’s a **repo-agnostic version** of the GPT command for deep simulated testing:

---

### 📢 GPT Command for Robust Sim Testing (Repo-Agnostic)

> **"Run a deep simulated test of the Python CLI and module structure for this project. Verify that all key entry-point scripts and modules can be imported without errors, that command-line interfaces respond correctly to `--help` or `-h`, and that critical public functions are defined and callable with expected arguments. Report any missing symbols, import errors, or CLI failures."**

---

### ✅ This Triggers:

* **🧠 Import resolution checks**
  Confirms that all `.py` modules load without crashing due to syntax/import issues.

* **🧪 CLI simulation**
  Runs each script with `--help` to validate `argparse` or `click` parsing integrity.

* **🔍 Symbol inspection**
  Ensures key functions and symbols (e.g., `main()`, `run_scan()`, etc.) exist and match expectations.

* **🚫 Runtime trap detection**
  Catches common pre-runtime bugs like missing functions, invalid CLI options, or broken default arguments.

---

This phrasing is robust for **most Python-based CLI utilities**, no matter the repo structure. You can extend it by naming specific modules or required behaviors. Let me know if you'd like a `preflight_check.py` that performs the same logic internally.
