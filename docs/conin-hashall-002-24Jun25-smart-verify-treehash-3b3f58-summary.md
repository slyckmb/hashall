# 🧠 Bullet Summary — Hashall Dev Chat (Smart Verify, Treehash, Inode)

## ✅ High-Level Themes
- Initiated a smart verification feature to compare migrated file trees
- Integrated database-backed scan reuse with session IDs
- Designed a `verify-trees` command that compares source and destination
- Added support for `.hashall/hashall.json` import/export
- Implemented treehash logic for subtree-level integrity verification
- Enhanced database schema: added inode, device_id, is_hardlink fields
- CLI enhancements via `cli.py`, new verify modules (`verify.py`, `verify_trees.py`, etc.)
- Supported cross-system ZFS migration use cases (hiker → glider)
- Added support tooling: git automation, rehydration digest, dashboarding

## 🧩 Implementation Highlights
- Created `verify.py`, `verify_trees.py`, `verify_session.py` under `src/hashall`
- Created `treehash.py` + tests for verifying SHA1-based tree hash derivation
- Renamed and used `scan_session.py` (formerly `scan.py`) to power session reuse
- Designed SQL schema updates and migration files for new columns + tables
- CLI wiring updated to expose `verify-trees` from `cli.py`
- Added `repair.py` stub and manifest prep logic for potential rsync repair
- Refactored Git branch creation into a robust utility `git-new-feature.sh`
- Created a full rehydration snapshot (`hashall_rehydration_digest.md`)
- Structured TODO.md phased roadmap and schema spec for auditability

## 🗃️ File System Impact
- File system hierarchy explored and reconciled with expectations
- Validated presence and scope of `scan_session.py` (vs older scan.py)
- Verified CLI + verify logic functional after multiple file updates
- Deferred non-blocking features (e.g. `subtree treehash`, `rsync` execution)

## 🧪 Testing & Tooling
- `tests/test_treehash.py` created to test `compute_treehash()` logic
- `digest --snapshot all` created for future rehydration
- Shell-based sandbox scan environment used to validate CLI
- `tree -P` and Git diff strategies employed to trace state

## 🔁 Rehydration/Preservation
- `todays_files.zip` and `hashall_rehydration_digest.md` created
- Final digests preserve state for future GPT session continuation

## 🧾 Key Scripts + Branches
- Branch: `dev/smart-verify-treehash`
- Scripts: `git-new-feature.sh`, Docker scripts, `hash-dash.sh`

## 🚀 What’s Left
- Final unit tests on `verify_trees.py`, `diff.py`, `verify.py`
- Complete rsync integration w/ manifest-based repair
- Full migration of logic into Python from shell
- Production CLI readiness + GitHub actions
